# Human-Centred_Reflections
Reflections for Human-Centred Complex Systems AUT 2021

# Week 1
This was the first week of the lectures, and it was clear from the get-go that I was going to learn a lot about types of interactions and, whilst I had a brief idea of systems from conversations that I had with teachers in the software topic, I knew there was a more complex idea at hand.  I remember, at the start of our software topic, our teacher was briefly talking about how things are interconnected and how everything when you look from the most miniscule things to the more of grand things, everything is part of a system, which is the part of a larger system, which... it goes on and on. And that was pretty much the bounds of system interactions that I had previously thought about. Hence, from the beginning of the lesson, talking about complex and complicated systems broadened my mind about at least the different types of systems. And so, through this, I took a  simplified approach to understand what complex system are, and with explanations in the lecture, I ending up creating:

![wk1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80301435/118756559-86c7e680-b8ae-11eb-9021-aca6c52903a8.png)

So, for my understanding, thought this does not cover all baes and is just for a basic foundation.
I thought that this week’s online engagement case study was very interesting. Personally, assessing that standing ovation in itself was a system was not something that I had though about, and so was eye opening. 


Within this introductory module, we learnt the concepts to understand what a complex system is and how they can be adapted to the context of human-centred complex systems. We also noted the difference between complex and complicated systems.

It is important to note that complex adaptive systems which means that they adapt via learning or evolution, for example, the stock market, the ecosystem, and any human-based decision making within a cultural and/or social system.

# Week 2

We started the module, "Understanding CAS: Many Model Thinking", where we see the importance of models and how they can be advantageous in almost any environment / workplace. Moreover, this week we also looked at our "toolkit" of models, as the different types of approaches of models.

From my understanding, a singular model is used to help us create a clearer picture of either what is going on, or what the future will hold for a certain system. And so, no one model can give a whole accurate, and in detail picture or representation of the complexities that are occurring for any selected case. Hence, this is why adapting a many-model mindset is so crucial to developing a clear understanding. 

Benefits of using models include:
*	Explain phenomena in a logical sense that will aid future strategic decision making
*	Can utilise, compare and test amounts of data that humans cannot (especially with the chance of human error)
*	Cognitive biases are erased (even if humans are unaware, they still hold biases)

Reasons as to why we want to create models include, to:
*	Be an intelligent citizen of the world
*	Think clearer
*	Use and understand data
*	Decide, strategies and design

Reasons to why to create models, to:
*	Reason
*	Explain
*	Design
*	Communicate
*	Act
*	Predict
*	Explore

Different approaches for modelling include:
*	Embodiment Approach (categorises either into big lumps, or strip away unnecessary aspects to distinctly search for what you're looking for)
*	Analogy Approach (stresses realism, creating ties from abstract to reality)
*	Alternative Reality Approach (More so, coded)


We also looked at the importance of wisdom and the wisdom hierarchy, looking at one to many models and the importance of using one model to many uses, discussing theorems such as wisdom of the crowd, Condorcet jury theorem and the diversity prediction theory, giving insights to how having several different groups coming to a consensus results in the most accurate answer. For me, though I did understand the concept of this, seeing that it was an actual model was cool, seeing that you can really model or even in the slightest theorise human behaviours, which some people may say is very unknown, is very interesting.

Therefore, as stated within the discussion board as it relates to my own experiences, adapting a many-model mindset has been very beneficial for me, as explained within my example. 

The simplest way I can explain many-model thinking would be to take a physics question into a physics classroom, then a mathematics classroom. Vector analysis and physical ideas aren't explored into scientific depth in the maths classroom, whilst they are of major importance within the physics classroom. For simplicity, in this example of different classrooms, you are applying a different approach for understanding the same vector problem. Hence, if we were to use the analogy approach to conclude what a many-model thinking mindset is, it would be the mindset of being present within both classrooms, and understanding the same concept in two different methods. Hence, this will give those physics and maths students a deeper understanding of the same problem, which is the desired result of many-model thinking. 

The risks of not adopting this mindset, means you are only limiting yourself to one explanation, maybe one that doesn’t explore all the links and ties that can be made to previous knowledge, meaning there is a gap between what you know and have learnt, and to what the real situation is. This becomes detrimental when looking for solutions or trying to seek predictions and trends, as if you are only looking at one aspect, your results become extremely limited.



# Week 3
For the start of our supermarket of models that comment on human behaviour (being this subject is human-centred), we started with 3 basic models, being:
* Rational 
  *	seeing when people will act selfishly, when they think rationally, factors include stakes, repetition, groups, easiness of choice)
* Behaviour 
  *	seeing when people will act selfishly, when they think rationally, factors include stakes, repetition, groups, easiness of choice)
  *	I had previously heard of the “experiment” where a group of people had to individually chose which buzzer to go with, a) one that will send an electric shock to them in 2 sec, or b) one that may or may not send an electric shock to them, and everyone had chosen a) because the condition meant that they were expecting a shock, rejecting the feeling of potentially and maybe in the second buzzer. People go towards the option where they know what to expect, they don’t like the unexpected. When talking about the examples in this model reminded me of this “experiment” and I thought that it was quite interesting.
  *	 1. Prospect theory – loss aversion
  *	 2. Hyperbolic discounting – thinking short term pretty much
  *	 3. Status Quo Bias – opting out rather than opting in
  *	 4. Anchoring Bias – basically what magicians do and pass off as psychic
* Rule-based 
  *	Fixed: most direct route
  *	Apadtive: Gradient-based method and evolutionary strategy

Decision making models help us to make decisions for the different types of problems, as they also provide us normative reasons and positive reasons to why a certain option should be chosen. Examples of multi-criterion decision making models include:
*	Spatial Choice Models (advertisers use to manipulate products to being ideal)
*	Probability (used for uncertain problems. 3 types: classical, frequency, subjective)
*	Decision Trees (concerned with the probability of an event occurring, and if the risk or value involved in greater or less than the probability)

We also looked at signalling, where people send signals to show status. We discuss conspicuous consumption which talks about the fact that humans care what others think of us and therefore pretty much anything we do is giving off a certain type of signal. Hence though this, the costly signalling theory becomes evident where the more costly something is the more meaning it has. The image posted on canvas pretty much sums it up.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80301435/118802170-2a33ee00-b8e5-11eb-967f-c3558a8bc063.png)

And hence, through discrete signalling and continuous signals and cases that concerns signalling, there is a constant relationship of involving a cost. Those who send the signal find that the benefits of identifying their greater wealth, ability, or even generosity are reduced by the cost of the signal. In addition, the time and effort spent signalling can be thought of as opportunity costs: resources could have been used in some other way, perhaps creating greater social surplus. 

Therefore, to make signalling less socially costly, the goal is to make signals as functional as possible. Better to have young people signal their physical fitness and bravery by playing team sports, where they learn rules of sportsmanship and collective interests, than to have them risk death jumping motorcycles. As previously noted, better to require doctors to memorise human anatomy than a random collection of capital cities. Nevertheless, wasteful signalling will persist.

Value and Power is then looked at, looking at how contributions change when things are considered as a group or when considered individually. Especially within IT, where IP isn’t always solely done by one person, and there are different people who need to be credited but sometimes are disregarded, therefore creating difficult circumstances. We talk about contributions within a group, and effectively how valuable you are (LOTB – last-on-the-bus) and a player’s Shapley value is then the value given to how “valuable” you are in the team. 

Perspectives --> Heursritics --> Team diversuty --> Recombination = Innovation


# Week 4
This lesson, we started off looking at system dynamics, which is essentially the (very paraphrasing here and simplifying), the qualitative way of representing systems through looking at how variables / factors / stocks influence each other. An example of a system dynamic model includes Stock-Flow diagrams and Causal-Loop Diagrams. It is very important to note that you have to assess system boundaries and certain limitations that occur through the model. Identifying this is extremely important when analysing the system so that you are looking at the system as an entirety, even things that aren’t in your set boundary. In a causal-loop diagram, when cycles or loops are found within the diagram, it is then when you have to see whether it is R or B ( self-reinforcing or self-balancing), and then identify the fundamental modes of interaction, being:
*	Exponential growth
*	Goal-Seeking
*	Oscillation

We also looked at networks, mainly talking about the structure, logic and functionality of networks. This was incredibly timely as it can obviously represent the social networks that has played a significant role in the covid-19 pandemic.

We then looked at agent-based modelling, which pretty much is the coding of simulations, considering the 3 main elements:
* Agents --> individual elements of the system
*	Environment --> outside factors
*	Rules --> certain ways in how the agents interact


# Week 5
In this lesson, we focused on probability distributions with a lot of math components, following aggregation, basic probability (discrete and continuous), distributions and linear models.
This week’s content was harder than usually to wrap my head around, just plainly because of the heavy math focus and though I had gone over at least similar ideas through HSC math advanced and extension course content, it was still harder to follow. However, the ideas of probability distributions, and random variables and sampling, are very familiar. Especially now where Covid-19 is being tested worldwide, and talks of sampling different people and groups have been discussed so that they can record any side affects that might occur with newer medicines / vaccines. 

The possible outcomes of random variables include:
1. Point Estimation
2. Interval Estimation
3. Hypothesis Test

The content about distribution was very interesting, and I must say, it was my first time hearing about long-tailed distributions, but I though it was quite interesting to see how these distributions can be seen in our daily lives. Examples of long-tailed distributions that our group discussed in class included:
* Population size/ income
* Usage of words in a language (for example, “the”, “and” and “like” those types of words would be used a lot, whilst words like “scientific” and more random words, not so much.

I found that social impacts of persuading certain actions was very, very interesting, and really makes you wonder, how, even unconsciously, you are being influenced by the people around you, who are probably influenced by other people, and how the cycle just goes on. Well, this ties back to distributions with the example of downloads for songs. In an experiment, students had the ability to sample and download songs. In the first treatment, they did not know what songs others downloaded, and the distributions of downloads had a shorter tail—no song received more than two hundred downloads and only one song received fewer than thirty. In a second treatment, students knew what others downloaded. The tail of the distribution grew: one song received more than three hundred downloads. Perhaps more telling, over half received fewer than thirty. The tail became longer. Social influence increased inequality. This inequality is not a concern if social influence leads people to download better songs. However, correlations between downloads in the two treatments were not strong. If we interpret the number of downloads of a song in the first treatment as a proxy for the song’s quality, social influence did not result in people downloading better songs. The big winners were not random, but they were not the best.


In class, the drafts and models that I had made for the book example are:

# Week 6
This lesson regarded, as the title states, how complex systems evolve over time. Hence, we looked at path dependence and the natural “evolution” of things with the outcome probabilities being dependant upon the sequence of past outcomes (meaning, if it becomes successful, keep it, if not change it). Examples of these include:
*	AC vs DV electricity
*	Common law
*	Economic success for a company (I’m undertaking an intro to IS course currently, where we explore the idea of innovation and customer-centric approaches, which pretty much sums this idea up)

Urn Models
As stated within the canvas document, *“To describe path dependence we will use a model based on urns, and this model will allow us to distinguish between models that are path dependent and those that are “phat” dependent—the order of events doesn’t matter but the set of things does.”* The point of this model is to see the process that are entirely path dependent or are only dependent for a specific period of time. 

We also looked at concavity and convexity, looking at:
*	Exponential growth
*	Economic groeth with using economy growth model
*	Solow’s growth model

We also looked at the models that assess conformity and unity that looks at riots and the networks involved, and why exactly certain people join riots. We talked about tipping points leads for a person to join, seeing that other have joined. 

We also looked at the Markov model that states that a system can be in a number of different states, and entities that comprise this system move between these states according to certain transition probabilities. It states how likely it is for something to move from one state to another. (To note, A random walk on a graph is a very special case of a Markov chain.) Interesting enough, this can be used to see if two countries who are on extreme tension, if they will go to war or not. 

As for the report that is due at the end of the semester, we had our first team meet via Zoom, where we pretty much delegated our roles and had set up a doc where Dev had already started adding bits of information and create a good draft of what we were going to submit in Week 8. 

![week6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80301435/118802700-ceb63000-b8e5-11eb-8d8b-b7b153742e49.png)


As for the report that is due at the end of the semester, we had our first team meet via Zoom, where we pretty much delegated our roles and had set up a doc where Dev had already started adding bits of information and create a good draft of what we were going to submit in Week 8. 

# Week 7
In this lecture, we looked at segregation and peer effects, pretty much looking at the social impacts that people naturally have. We looked at Schelling’s Segregation Model which pretty much explains the fact that people will gravitate towards areas where it will benefit them, or is more familiar to them. This includes racial segregation and class segregation in real life. When I heard Schelling’s Model, my first thought went to New York City, and the completely distant socio-economic areas that New York homes. I thought that this model provides good insight to human behaviour, and why over a period of time, segregation occurs.

For our assignment, I was thinking that we could use this to simulate lockdown possible. Though this model is usually used to describe racial segregation or class segregation, my though process was, if we adapt this model to define the segregated part of society to be those who are ill and can transfer the COVID-19 virus. Having society be compiled with 2 parts, those who are healthy and those who are not, helps us to utilise this model to simulate the effects of what a lockdown would do. For example, if one person has a COVID-19 case, they are segregated from the rest of the un-ill society. When someone else contracts the virus, they now become part of the now 2-men-band and hence how the segregation increases. Placing preventative measures such as lockdowns prevents the increase of the segregated group. When the incubation period of the sick man is over, he then becomes part of normal society again, and there is no segregation. Hence through this model we will be looking at a dynamic segregated group, unlike other serious segregation topics such as race and class, rather after the incubation period, those who were initially sick can be part of normal society again.

Update: because of the teacher’s feedback on making it too muffled with the pure intention of the model being for racial, class and pure segregation, this is no longer in the assignment. 

The bottom line is that the importance for culture is paramount to our human biology, and so these segregation models and models simulating social impacts will definitely stay to comment on human behaviours for forever. 

In reference to our team, we had a Zoom meeting again on Thursday, where we pretty went over what needed to be done. We were pretty good since we already condensed a bunch of information in our document, and we were reading several articles about previous models and examples of models that other had used. It was a quite short meeting, just checking up and ensuring that we all were on the same page.

A few days later, as a group we realised, we hadn’t done the rich picture within the stakeholders section, so Lara and I made one and pasted it in our group Google Doc.


# Week 8
The first time I heard the Colonel Blotto Strategy, is quite a simple strategy, pretty much saying that you don’t have to allocate your resources evenly to win, and that sometimes, keeping reserved in some areas might actually help in the long run. This can easily be relatable and applied to when a student is working on an assignment. They will look at the marks allocated, and therefore, respond accordingly. If one section allocates 5 marks, while the other 20, it is clear to how you will spend your resources, focusing more on the 20-marker. To me, it’s fascinating how this can be applied to so many different things, as mentioned within the canvas pages.  
It is important to note that both luck and skill contribute to the success, and so, for the fact that we are focusing on many-model thinking, it is clear to see how many-model thinking can be applied for this strategy too, showing the underlying dynamics of the game.

The Prisoner’s Dilemma is an infamous game where two people can either:
*	Agree --> payoff of 4
*	One defect --> payoff of 2
*	Both defect --> payoff of 6

And again, I am surprised at how many applications there are of this idea. These include:
*	Arms control
*	Price competition
*	Technological adoption
*	Political campaign

There are seven different ways for cooperation, which gets into mathematical probabilities, but the main ideas are:
1. Direct reciprocity
2. Reputation – Indirect reciprocity
3. Network reciprocity
4. Group selection
5. Kin Selection
6. Laws / Prohibitions
7. Incentives

Collective Action Problems is related to the fact that the outcome that results from self-interest does not align with the community’s outcome, however for the general community to succeed, you have to be selfless. Collective action problems tend to be easier to solve the smaller and more homogeneous the group of individuals or actors involved and the better the information.

Whereas, for the report, this week was the submission for the first part of the assignment, so therefore, our group made sure that our document was up to date, and Dev had converted it to a word document, sent it to all of us so we could look over it again, and then he submitted it. Quite a smooth process.

# Week 9
This week, as a team we asked if anyone had any questions, and so I did have a question regarding the assignment, so Lara and I went to the consultation to the teacher. I had a few questions about the models and with the rise of the noncoding and coding option, and what was correct to do. The team had communicated earlier and knew of my question, so after the consultation, we filled the rest of the team in about what path we were going to take with the options, so that they were also in the loop. 

The main challenge that I had was related to the code. The code that we had found was very large, and quite confusing. Especially as a first-time GitHub user, it was quite confusing. So, I made sure that I worked on the causal loop diagram as early as possible to give enough time to figure out the code. 


# Week 10
The team met on Thursday this week. This was the first meet after the feedback was released. As a group, we made sure that all changes that were needed to be done to the submitted document was done. We also went over again the 2 non-coding and 1 coding stance that we took for the coding and what that meant for roles and responsibilities. Nothing drastic changed, rather everything got quite simplified. At this point Lara and I had talked about the 2 non-coding models and came up with variables and factors that we thought we should include and made sure to have referencing papers that we could look to if we got stuck in the process.

# Week 11
We met twice this week, once on Tuesday and once on Saturday, just making sure that we were all on top of our tasks. At the start of the week, I had already made the diagram for the causal loop diagram, and Lara had made the stock-flow diagram. Documentation was mainly left, and Lara was mainly focused on completing the ABM model. We also included more reference papers as a guide. Below are diagrams from those papers. It is important to note that we also found and changed the code to something much simpler, and now that Lara is working on the ABM model, I have more time to focus on the documentation of Section 4 in its entirety, whilst Lara completes the ABM model and parts of the documentation that I can’t do.

# Week 12
These few days were pretty much polishing the document and formatting it, and ensuring that everyone had the same copy to later submit. We all edited the whole document through Google Docs and then Dev converted it to a word.docx and sent the final copy through email and then we individually added our own reflections.

I also attended the lecture where we went through a review of all the models that we had gone through, referencing the image below.
